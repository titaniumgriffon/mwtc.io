Who's running this show?
: The volunteers around MWTC are exactly that: Volunteers. They do not get any financial gain in any way from the conference. 

How much does it cost? 
: Nada
: Zilch
: Zero
: Free

How can it be free? 
: Sponsors! They contribute funds to allow us to do this. The funds will be used to pay for any expenses incurred for the conference and any remaining funds will be either returned to the sponsor, or donated to an appropriate non-profit organization.
