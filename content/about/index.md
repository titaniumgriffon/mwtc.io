Mid West Tech Conference started in 2025. The premise behind the conference is to give those in the technical industries (or hobbyists or enthusiasts or anyone really) a place to network and discuss Information Technology and surrounding subjects, without feeling like they are being nudged by vendors towards specific products. The volunteers around MWTC are exactly that: Volunteers. They do not get any financial gain in any way from the conference, unlike some conferences where the vendors end up making bank, but I digress.
